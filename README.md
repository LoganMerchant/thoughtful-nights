## Installation
To install the API for Thoughtful Nights, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine. Once that is done, navigate to the root directory of this cloned repository, where you'll need to run the command `npm install` to install the necessary npm packages.


## Usage
Please refer to this [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lfscYii0Cv5Eb9b-vP1yMEIDz0Igrn--/view) as a demonstration of the API in use. The video simply shows all the routes in action, so if you would like a more granular look at them, you can find the express.js routes in the `routes` folder and the mongoose.js queries in the `controllers` folder.


## How to Contribute
The major missing piece of Thoughtful Nights is obviously a front-end. I will be working on this in the future, but if you would like to help with that or have any ideas on the design, you can find my email below.
