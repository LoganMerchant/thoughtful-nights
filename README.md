## Installation
To install the API for Thoughtful Nights, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine. Once that is done and you have navigated to the root directory of this clone repository, you'll need to run the command `npm install` to install the necessary npm packages.


## Usage
Please refer to this [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lfscYii0Cv5Eb9b-vP1yMEIDz0Igrn--/view) as a demonstration of the API in use. The routes are not shown in great detail in this video, so if you would like a clearer look at them, you'll find the routes in the `routes` folder and the controllers in the `controllers` folder.


## How to Contribute
The major missing piece of Thoughtful Nights is a front-end. I will be working on this in the future, but if you would like to help or shoot any idea my way, you can find my email below.
